# Task-Management-App

A personal Android project focused on UI implementation using Material 3, inspired by a task management app design originally found on Dribbble.
Rather than a pixel-perfect recreation, this app adapts and reinterprets the original design to better align with Material 3 guidelines, Android interaction patterns, and Jetpack Compose best practices.

The goal is to take a visually appealing concept and translate it into a functional, idiomatic Android UI, making design decisions where the original concept does not naturally fit the Material ecosystem.

Screenshots or screen recordings will be added as the UI evolves.

# Purpose

This project is intended for learning and experimentation:

- Adapting non-Material designs into Material 3–compliant UIs
- Practicing Jetpack Compose layout structure and component composition
- Exploring theming, color schemes, and typography with Material 3
- Applying modern Android architecture and UI patterns
- Making intentional design trade-offs between inspiration and platform guidelines
